tuSync [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cfstras/tuSync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cfstras/tuSync)
======

###Why?
i was looking for a solution to sync my _iTunes_ library to my _Android_ device for a long time.

###Pros
_tuSync_ is aimed to take your music library, have you select any number of playlists from it,
and then sync every title contained in them into a chosen folder (or your _mobile device_).
the files are still neatly organized into folders and don't have any duplicates.

also, your playlists are exported into _.m3u_ files, which get copied to the destination folder.

###Cons
currently, only _iTunes_ libraries are supported, but that should change soon.

if your library has duplicates, they will most likely be synced, too. will fix that once i get a report :D


###Disclaimer
*This program is far from finished.*
It may destruct your computer, your whole network or induce World War III.
I am not responsible for anything this code does on your computer, your family or your cat.
You are completely on your own, I probably don't yet know myself how to solve any problems you might encounter
(If I did, I would have fixed it).
