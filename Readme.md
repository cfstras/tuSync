tuSync
======

i was looking for a solution to sync my iTunes library to my Android device for a long time, so i made this.


tuSync is aimed to take your music library, have you select any number of playlists from it,
and then sync every song contained in them into another folder (or your mobile device).
the files are still neatly organized into folders and don't have any duplicates.

also, your playlists are exported into .m3u files, which get copied to the destination folder.

currently, only iTunes Libraries are supported, but that should change soon.
